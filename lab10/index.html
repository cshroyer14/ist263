            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently majoring in broadcast and digital journalism in Newhouse, with a minor in Italian and Information Management and Technology. I chose a journalism major due to my love for sports and passion to share my knowledge and predictions with fans. I enjoy every sport for the most part, but specifically watch the four major American sports. I am an avid UFC fan and hope to be able to work in the MMA field in the future. </p>

            <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
            <p>Outside of school and work, I am either working out or doing something related to sports. I enjoy doing research on predictions and watching it unfold in the game itself. As mentioned before, I am a huge UFC fan and like watching whenever I can. Being from Long Island, I'm very spoiled with food. My favorite has to be pizza and bagels, but only from LI. I also enjoy playing golf and other recreational sports.</p>
