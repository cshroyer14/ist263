        <p>The Port Washington Vikings varsity golf team defeated Comsewogue/Miller Place on May 30 to win the boys golf Long Island championship for the first time since 1989. The Vikings took down the combined team 7.5-1.5 on Bethpage Black, one of the toughest courses in the country.</p>

        <p>After winning the Nassau County championship a week prior, the 10-0 Vikings were able to keep their streak of dominance afloat at Bethpage Black. Junior Bryce Karty led all golfers with a 10-over on the par 71 course. Eighth-grader Dylan Reyes shot an 87, while senior James Fabrikant shot a 90. Karty, Reyes, Max Baum (91) and Ian Mandelbaum were all able to win their matchups in the championship, with junior Noah Lapter tying his.</p>

        <p>The Vikings’ depth and chemistry played a major role in their run to the Long Island Championship, according to coach Mike Killoran. “With everyone being back together, I would mix up the lineup a lot,” Killoran said. “My three through six was very interchangeable and I think that those two things combined were a catalyst for success.”</p>

        <p>Fabrikant, who has been a staple since joining the varsity team in eighth-grade, finished this season shooting an average of just one-over. Playing golf since a young kid, Fabrikant has learned a great deal on and off the course. When first joining the team, former players Joe Melkonian, Luke and Jacob Fain provided useful advice.</p>

        <p>“They told me not to worry about every stroke, and just have fun with the game,” Fabrikant said.</p>

        <p>Being a long-tenured player, Fabrikant has seen the ups and downs of the team. He took the advice he was given and applied it.</p>

        <p>“I believe I helped everyone stay calm and have fun,” Fabrikant said. “We all practiced a lot but I made sure we still enjoyed the season and each other’s company. I loved my team this year because everyone contributed.”</p>

        <p>Being a golf, football, and girl’s basketball coach for Schreiber, Killoran has seen many things through his coaching career. However, one thing he has yet to see in his time as a coach is a lady golfer.</p>

        <p>“We are technically just a varsity team, not a boys golf team,” Killoran said. “There hasn’t been a lady on the Schreiber team in quite some time and that’s something I’d like to change. Hopefully winning this championship has sparked some interest and we’re always welcoming new players.”</p>
