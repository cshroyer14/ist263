    <section>
    <p>The PIT Teen Center of Port Washington, located at Landmark on Main Street, recently held a teen travel camp during the last two weeks in July. The age requirements for the camp are 12-14, targeting the middle school transitioning into high school range.  </p>

    <br>

    <p>The beauty of this travel camp is that it doesn’t entail overnight stays. The schedule is devised completely for the purpose of a day trip. Each day’s adventure was different from the last, going to places such as Six Flags, the Long Island Aquarium, Coney Island, and much more. The teen travel camp was created thanks to donations from the Community Chest and Peter and Jeri Dejana Foundation.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>The kids arrive anywhere from 8:15 to 8:45 in the morning, which is perfect for parents day jobs. The itinerary after that varied depending on the destination. The day typically starts off calm, allowing the teens to play sports in the gym, or just hang out in the lounge area. The PIT Lounge area has something for everyone to do, including video games, arts and crafts, pool, table tennis, and more. The campers and counselors would then go on their designated trips and return early or late, depending on location.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Mike Donnolly, director of the PIT Teen Center, has been working with the PIT and Port Washington Children Center since 2001. After recently turning his attention solely to the PIT, Donnolly has worked to make sure the PIT has something for everyone in all age groups. “My analogy is that I like to give the teens the keys to the car while I’m the passenger,” Donnolly said. “I want to empower them to be able to come up with what they want to see.  </p>

    <p>The PIT has a youth council which meets on Monday nights who are in charge of creating and setting up activities for members. During the school year, themes vary from middle school only, to video game tournaments, to basketball night. Donnolly explained how “it’s a good opportunity to get the kids doing something in a supervised, safe environment.” The PIT is not only beneficial to children, but to the parents as well. It allows them to go to work stress-free and know that their children are having a great time in a supervised environment
